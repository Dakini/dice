/// Here's the way the dot cal target dots are located in the image:
/// First a binary threshold is applied to the image.
/// Then the three marker dots (the doughnut dots) are located in the image.
/// Once the three marker dots are located, the closest two, non-colinear regular dots are found for each marker,
/// these dots define the cardinal directions for each marker dot.
/// Next, the origin, xaxis, and yaxis marker dots are assigned in the following way: the origin is the marker dot
/// that is closest in terms of perpendicular distance from the lines created by the cardinal direction dots and the marker dots.
/// That leaves two marker dots to identify as the x and y axis dots. the xaxis dot is the marker dot furthest from the origin.
/// The same process that was used to identify the origin marker dot is used to identify the regular dot that is opposite the origin
/// in the box defined by the three marker dots. These four points are then used to determine the affine transform from a
/// regular grid to the image locations of the dots. The number of dots in x and y is determined by finding all the dots
/// within a tolerance of the x and y axis created by the origin and the other marker dots.
